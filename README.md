# Evolution of Todo – Phase One

Project files live in `phase-one/`. Change into that directory for all commands:

```bash
cd phase-one
python -m todo list
python -m unittest discover -s tests -t .
```

The detailed README, specs, and code are inside `phase-one/`.

Phase II (full-stack) will live under `phase-two/` as it is developed.
